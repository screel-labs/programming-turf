`https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-a-binary-tree/1`

Serialization is to store a tree in an array so that it can be later restored and Deserialization is reading tree 
back from the array. Now your task is to complete the function serialize which stores the tree into an array A[ ] 
and deSerialize which deserializes the array to tree and returns it.

Note: The structure of tree must be maintained.

#### Input:

The task is to complete two method serialize and deSerialize.  
The method serialize takes  two arguments, the first is the root of Binary Tree and second argument is an array A[ ] which 
stores the serialized tree. The method deSerialize takes only one argument which is the serialized array A[] and 
returns the deserialzed tree's root . The struct Node has a data part which stores the data, pointer to left child and 
pointer to right child.There are multiple test cases. For each test case, this method will be called individually.

#### Output:

The  output in the expected output will be the inorder traversal of the returned tree .

#### Constraints:

1 <=T<= 30
1 <= Number of nodes<= 100
1 <= Data of a node<= 100

#### Example(To be used only for expected output):

#### Input

2
2
1 2 L 1 3 R
4
10 20 L 10 30 R 20 40 L 20 60 R

#### Output

2 1 3
40 20 60 10 30


There are two test casess.  
* First case represents a tree with 3 nodes and 2 edges where root is 1, left child of 1 is 3 and right child of 1 is 2.   
* Second test case represents a tree with 4 edges and 5 nodes.
